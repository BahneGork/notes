## History of the Shadow Company
[[The Chronicle]] is the big black book that [[Copper]] keeps safe, he is not a chronicler but he knows some of the procedures and rules of the Company related to the [[Shadow Company Chronicler]].

The become a member of the company one has to place a bloody thumb next to their name in the book.

The book has a section for each title that lists all the names that has had these titles, with a bloody thumbprint next to them. They get crossed out when they die.

The commander has the power to bestow a title onto a member of the company. The [[Shadow Company Commander]] must perform the [[Rite of Shadow Promotion]] which must be witnessed by the [[Shadow Company Chronicler]]. When the rite is complete the book bestows the title and it's assosiated powers onto the member.
